| :------- | :----------------: | ---------------------------------------------------------: |
| { }      |   paragraph walk   |                        moves by huge block contiguous mode |
| %        | jump matching pair | jump to the matching pair of brackets braces / parantheses |

% jump doesn't work
go a little up `12k + w + %` gotta land onto the curly braces tho
you can also `f{ + %` its really intuitive
use to get to the top of the function
*note* doesn't work on "quotes"

to delete the if statement
`SHIFT V + 3j + d`
`d4d`
`di{`
`d2i{`
`ci{` works with paragraphs as well
`cip` - deletes paragraph and puts into INSERT mode 
`i` can be used for motion?
`yi(` - to copy the insides of the paranthese
`vi(` - to copy the insides of the brackets

`va(` - to copy the insides of the brackets incl. brackets
`da{` include the curly brace
`diw` delete the current word that we're on, if in the middle of a word.



*bold* capitalized version is backward and forwards
