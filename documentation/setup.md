## Observations

Clipboard Copy Paste outside of vim.

fixed mdx and the tables shits as well, apparently you needed to use mdx for the scripts to function properly.

either I can preview it or it just fucking doesn't work.

mdx doesn't have shortcuts setup for the regular shit.

if I enable file associations shit just wouldn't work like it does.
