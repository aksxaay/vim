get a CTRL + p like plugin because it matches

open up a different file really quickly.
- fuzzy finder (telescope?)
- swap between the last 2 files
- CTRL + ^ (swap files)


Types of Marks
- local marks (within the files)
- global marks

have 3 - 4 marks at any one time and keep them on your most active fingers
most important - least importan
primary - secondary - tertiary - quaternary

logical groupings of them.

how to mark.

`mt` - mark to file at <t>
`"t` - jump back to file at <t>
in file marks are weird.

`'t` - I guess is for the local marks these are a little tricky.
global marks can be anything.

`mH` - global mark at just about anything. mark at this line position any file.
`"H` - this is pretty convenient.


```
:ls list
:bd delete
]b next
[b prev
]B last
[B first
Ctrl-6 alternate
:e add one file
:n add multiple files
:b select by buffer name
```

`ysiw<input({[>` to immediately bracket the word you're looking at



It's easiest to explain with examples.

Press cs"' inside

"Hello world!" to change it to

'Hello world!'

--

Now press cs'<q> to change it to

<q>Hello world!</q>

--

To go full circle, press cst" to get

"Hello world!"

--

To remove the delimiters entirely, press ds".

Hello world!

--

Now with the cursor on "Hello", press ysiw] (iw is a text object).

[Hello] world!

Let's make that braces and add some space (use } instead of { for no space): cs]{

{ Hello } world!

--

Now wrap the entire line in parentheses with yssb or yss).

({ Hello } world!)

--

Revert to the original text: ds{ds)

Hello world!

--

Emphasize hello: ysiw<em>
```html
<em>Hello</em> world!
```
--

Finally, let's try out visual mode. Press a capital V (for linewise visual mode) followed by S<p class="important">.
```html
<p class="important">
  <em>Hello</em> world!
</p>
```
I believe this is practice
